Artificial intelligence is taking the world by storm. All industries are looking at how to apply AI, and all professionals are trying to figure out how to leverage it, or risk being replaced by it. Data is the fuel of artificial intelligence. Any AI solution is only as good as the data that powers it. Abracadata is a global initiative focused on highlighting the importance of data and the people who work behind the scenes to make AI possible.
